## About imex

Imex is a plugin for [papermc](https://papermc.io). It provides many
immersive and lore friendly extensions for vanilla minecraft.
All of the features follow a strict **no-nonsense** rule.
Every feature has a real value to the players or the admins,
and is designed to augment vanilla experience in a lore friendly way.

Everything should *enhance* multiplayer vanilla minecraft experience
without adding any unnecessary anti-features and without breaking players
out of the good "vanilla" feeling.

This means there will be a lot of little things and quality of life additions,
some generally appreciated features (regions, portals), as well as a few server moderation utilities.

Also, all features are modularized and can be disabled independently of each other.
So if you don't want a certain feature, you can simply disable it.
