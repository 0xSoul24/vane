/**
 * Decides when a region owner hears about visitors, so a busy region rings the Bar once instead of
 * for every player walking in.
 *
 * - The first visitor of a quiet region is reported right away.
 * - Visitors after that are collected for [windowMillis] and reported together, at most
 *   [MAX_NAMES] by name, with the total in [Alert.count]. A window that collected anyone is
 *   followed by another one, so a steady stream of visitors yields one summary per window.
 * - Each visitor counts at most once per region per [cooldownMillis], so someone pacing along a
 *   border is reported once.
 *
 * Holds no Bukkit state: the caller passes the time and delivers what [emit] receives.
 *
 * @param windowMillis how long visitors are collected after an alert.
 * @param cooldownMillis how long a visitor stays unreported in a region after being counted.
 * @param emit receives each alert.
