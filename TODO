#### IDEAS

- [ ] trampelpfad
- [ ] better elytra flight mechanics
- [ ] add a mechanic to update in-game maps (e.g. with a custom item, or redstone)
- [ ] player heads from /heads
- [ ] lodestone portal scrolls teleport ontop of the stone
- [ ] double door mechanic is broken for two single doors with opposite hinges after one another (visual two block, actual 0 block distance).


- permission audit for all players with moderator level
- add permissions by uuid
- sleep day -> get night
- private /msg /tell permission
- portal scrolls show total uses
- ultra infinity for all arrow types (put on arrow?)


MAYBE FIXED:
- double sleep time set bug, cancel other tasks
- bed remove on sun brrrrrr not works






bedtime: dynmap marker


region -> zone


portal domes? projector like setup for full-dome or even sphere!

if resource pack serving is disabled, use real strings of current language!! NICE



portal selection as big sphere around player with itemsss
  sneak -> other selection?

- [ ] descr level bottle
- [ ] bottle fill max

- [ ] better pack icon
- [ ] github readme banners
- [ ] crafting recipes in readme
- [ ] download links
- [ ] software licenses
- [ ] region chunk based cache
- [ ] armor stand poser manipulation by perpendicular intersection between Line of sight and arm 
- [ ] item frame invisibilinator (visible if empty)
- [ ] custom enchantment book icons
- [ ] player list footer header configuration
- [ ] transmutation tool copy pasta with direction awareness
- [ ] sign editing (a tool ?)
- [ ] add items to shulker box by right click with item in inventory on box?
- [ ] Maybe "Advancements to guide you through most additions"
- can we inherit spectator skins? maybe hook into data loading?
- golden sickle -> golden mistletoe, mistel (viscum album)

SERVER SETTINGS RECOMMENDATIONS

- spawn with remnants of old world
- dont merge items, or very small merging radius.
