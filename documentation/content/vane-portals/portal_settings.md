#### 6 Additional Things

The owner of the portal will see more entries in the menu to personalize the portal, or to delete it again. In the settings menu you can change the name, icon and style, as well as toggle the visibility. If you want your portal to be public, you should select that now.

#### 7 Icon & style

**Icon:** In the icon selector, you can choose a block from your inventory as the portal icon. This will be displayed along with its name above the console of a portal where your portal is set as a target. You can also use one of the many decorative heads.

**Style:** In the style selector, you can either use one of the predefined styles, or create your own. When building the frame, you used different blocks. Each of these blocks can now be replaced by any other block. By default, everything is made of obsidian. There is a distinction between active and inactive portals, so you can for example display one of the blocks as a glass when inactive, and as a sea lantern when activated. This allows you to create many interesting styles.

You can also change the portal area block when inactive, for example to completely hide your portal when it is turned off. Don't forget to press **Apply** at the end to make your changes visible.
