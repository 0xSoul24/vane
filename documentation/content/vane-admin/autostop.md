```toml
title = "Automatic server stop"
icon = "minecraft:clock"
module = "vane-admin"
```

To save on your server's resources, vane will stop your server when 20 minutes have passed
while the server is empty.
This feature is especially great combined with the [autostart](#feature-vane-waterfall--autostart) feature by vane-waterfall,
which automatically starts your server when someone tries to connect to it.

Check out our [Server Installer](https://oddlama.github.io/minecraft-server) for information on how set this up correctly.
