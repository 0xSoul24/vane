#### 1 Overview

**Regions** allow you to buy a piece of land. In your regions you can assign other players **rights** like building rights or container rights, as well as set conditions within the region (explosions, monster spawn, PVP, ...).

#### 2 Usage

There are regions and region groups. **Regions** are purchased pieces of land, and are assigned to a region-group. In **region-groups**, you can assign rights to players by assigning them a **role**.
